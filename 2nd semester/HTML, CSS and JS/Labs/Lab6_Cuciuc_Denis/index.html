                                    <h2>Why java?</h2>
                                    <article>
                                          <p>Java is easy to write and easy to runâ€”this is the foundational strength of
                                                Java and why many developers program
                                                in it. When you write Java once, you can run it almost anywhere at any
                                                time.</p>
                                          <p>Java can be used to create complete applications that can run on a single
                                                computer or be distributed across
                                                servers and clients in a network.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>As a result, you can use it to easily build mobile applications or run on
                                                desktop applications that use
                                                different operating systems and servers, such as Linux or Windows.

                                                Once a developer is familiar with installing JDK, setting up PATH and
                                                understanding how CLASSPATH works they
                                                will be able to build code easily.
                                          </p>

                                    <h2>Java Benefits</h2>
                                    <article>Java is platform-independent.
                                          One of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move easily
                                          from one computer system to another. The ability to run the same program on
                                          many different systems is crucial to World Wide Web software, and Java
                                          succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary
                                          levels.

                                    <article>Hibernate reduces lines of code by maintaining object-table mapping itself
                                          and returns result to application in form of Java objects. It relieves
                                          programmer from manual handling of persistent data, hence reducing the
                                          development time and maintenance cost.

                                    <h2>Hibernate and JPA vs. JDBC</h2>
                                    <article>Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an API packaged with the Java SE
                                          edition that makes it possible to standardize and simplify the process of
                                          connecting Java applications to external, relational database management
                                          systems (RDBMS).Fundamentally, applications written in Java perform logic. The
                                          Java language provides facilities for performing iterative logic with looks,
                                          conditional logic with if statements and object-oriented analysis through the
                                          use of classes and interfaces. But Java applications do not store data
                                          persistently.

                                          Data persistence is typically delegated to NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and
                                          Cassandra, or to relational databases such as IBM's DB2 or Microsoft's SQL
                                          Server or the popular open source database MySQL.

                                          To help address the object-relational impedance mismatch, a number of
                                          frameworks exist that simplify the task of moving data between a relational
                                          database and a Java program. Popular object-relational mapping (ORM)
                                          frameworks include Hibernate, TopLink and DataNucleus. While each framework
                                          has its own set of unique capabilities, all of them comply with the Java
                                          Persistence API standard, which is now part of the Java EE/Jakarta EE
                                          specification.</article>

                              <h2>Java Clean Code - How to Write Clean Code in Java?</h2>
                              <p>Clean code is code that is easy to understand and maintain. In short, clean coding is
                                    the way of writing code such that the code is easily readable, testable, and less
                                    prone to errors.
                                    <br><br>
                                    There are several principles that should be kept in mind while developing a software
                                    application. Some of these principles are SOLID principles, DRY and KISS principles.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Apart from principles, there are certain properties such as high cohesion and low
                                    coupling, documented code, proper naming, project structure, etc. that leads to
                                    quality code.There can be multiple answers to this question, but we will choose the
                                    most suitable answer. We need to care about Clean Code because it eventually shows
                                    the programmer's capability of writing a well-maintainable piece of code that is
                                    easily understood by other developers that are going to work with that code.
                                    <br><br>
                                    See, in real life, when a programmer works on a codebase, there is a high chance
                                    that at some point in time, other programmers also work on the same codebase. Hence,
                                    the programmer needs to write clean code as it will eventually be easier for other
                                    programmers to handle that code. More precisely, it will be easier to troubleshoot
                                    errors that can appear in the future.
